# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Interactive/animated poetry visual narrative*

![sketch of idea1's general flow](images/image1.jpg)

My idea is to create an interactive readthrough/narrative of a chosen poem. The design will feature different visual representations of the poem, as well as the actual poem itself, that are interactive for the reader through actions such as clicking, hovering, dragging, and scrolling. I want this to be more an web-based art project that I can include in my art portfolio, so I want to enhance and convey the chosen narrative through visuals, sound, interactions, and animations.

To ensure accessibility, I'll make sure to provide alt-texts for all visuals so that it's compatible with screen readers. I'll also make sure interactions can be navigated in a logical manner using Tab. While colors will be an important part of the design, I'll also make sure to use patterns and shapes to differentiate elements.

### *Machine knitting designer/visualizer*

![sketch of idea2's user flow](images/image2.jpg)


This idea aims to create an web interface that allows a user to draw out a 2 color design and then convert it to Knitout code, which allows it to be knitted out in a double knit on standard knitting machines. The main component of this will be a user drawing box, where users can draw their own design. The application then convert this into Knitout code, which can be then downloaded and ran by knittting machines.


To ensure accessibility, I'll make sure the page is navigatable by Tab key. I'll also include a how to instruction page with introductions and explanations on machine knitting, Knitout, and the double knit. Lastly, I'll also use high contrast colors to ensure the page is accessible to visually impaired users.


### *Trinket Galore*


![Trinket Galore workflow/visual sketches](images/image3.jpg)

My third idea is a web based game inspired by ones such as Rat Shrine [Rat Shrine](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/shrine/), where anonymous users can submit their trinkets, knickknacks, and general objects of affection. They'd then be morphed together into a singular collective 3d trinket sculpture/shrine in the palace. Potentially other features will be to trade trinkets with other users, and to spin the 3D model to view and find your own. 

To ensure accessibility, I'll make sure the page is navigable by Tab key. I'll also use high contrast colors and offer alt texts to all visuals to ensure screen reader combatibility.

## Feedback Summary
Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words). 

My first idea received the most interest. People thought that it was interesting and would fit nicely in my art portfolio. It'll be very interaction and animation heavy, which would be a good exercise of my web development skills. The critique I received was on the complexity level and that a poem would not have enough complexities. Some ideas others gave me is to add multiple poems or allow for user input of poems, or to make sure the complexity and number of interactions was sufficient.

The second idea has a good bit of technical potential. People found it unique and thought it showcases both web development and design skills, and my personal interest in textiles and machine knitting. One area of concern was the technical difficulty. This would require figuring out an algorithm to translate visuals to knitout code on the backend and take a lot of energy away from practicing frontend web development. Another was on the drawing interface for users, and considering what interaction feedbacks there would be to users to ensure that it’s responsive and user-friendly. Another suggestion was to add a preview feature for how the Knitout design would look when knitted, which could help users feel more confident in their creations.

The third idea is mostly received critique on complexity issues that need addressing. One major concern is the backend infrastructure and how the website will efficiently track and store user inputs. Developing a robust database might introduce challenges, making it crucial to simplify the scope to avoid bugs and ensure a smooth experience. Additionally, there’s the technical question of morphing 2D submissions into 3D shapes. While some loss of detail may be acceptable, it’s uncertain how this will affect the final aesthetic of the trinket sculpture. Overall, these complexities could impact the project's feasibility.

## Feedback Digestion
Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.


For my first idea, which focuses on creating an interactive poem experience, I received valuable feedback suggesting enhancements for complexity. Initially, I considered incorporating multiple poems to enrich the narrative, but I decided against this, as I want to customize the visuals and interactive elements specific to each poem, and ensuring that the complexity of the narrative itself is sufficient to engage users. I will also ensure that the interactions are diverse, providing various ways for users to connect with the text visually and audibly. This focused approach will help create a more impactful experience.


The second idea involves developing a web interface for designing patterns that convert to Knitout code. The feedback highlighted the need for a user-friendly drawing interface and meaningful interaction feedback. To address this, I will prioritize designing a responsive interface that provides clear feedback during user interactions likely through using an microinteraction library. Additionally, I’ll incorporate a preview feature that allows users to visualize their designs before finalizing them. While the idea showcases my interest in textiles, I must ensure that the technical aspects do not overwhelm and I end up with a less sophisticated interface and user experience.


The third idea, centered around a web-based game for submitting and morphing trinkets, faced significant critiques regarding complexity. The primary concerns revolved around backend infrastructure and the challenge of morphing 2D to 3D models. After careful consideration, I’ve decided against this idea, as the backend complexity could detract from creating a smooth user experience. Instead, I will redirect my efforts toward the one of the two ideas, where I can focus on frontend development and interactivity. This decision will allow me to concentrate on projects that enhance my skills while ensuring a more seamless and engaging user experience.
